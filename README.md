# CodeMapper üó∫Ô∏è

## Overview

CodeMapper is a tool designed to **analyze large Go codebases** and visualize function dependencies in an interactive graph.  
It helps you understand how functions and methods are connected across your project, making onboarding and refactoring much easier! üöÄ

> **UI Inspiration:**  
> The interactive graph UI is inspired by the intuitive workflow editor of [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/), making it easy to explore and understand complex code relationships visually.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

Analyzing over **40+ repositories** for a recent project was extremely time-consuming and challenging, especially given the tight deadlines and complex interdependencies between packages. Manual tracing of function calls and dependencies quickly became unmanageable. To address this, I built CodeMapper to automate the analysis and visualization process, making it much faster and easier to understand large Go codebases.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Automatic Go code analysis** üßë‚Äçüíª
- **Dependency mapping** between functions and methods üîó
- **Two visualization modes**:
  - **Flow View**: Traditional ReactFlow-based visualization with n8n.io-inspired interface üåä
  - **Graph View**: Obsidian-style graph visualization with circular nodes and expandable neighbors üåê
- **Interactive exploration** in your browser üåê
- **Easy to use**: just point to your repo and run!

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Scan your Go project**:  
   CodeMapper parses your codebase, finds all function/method definitions and their call sites.

2. **Generates a dependency map**:  
   Outputs a JSON file mapping all relationships.

3. **Visualizes the map**:  
   Launches a web server with two beautiful, interactive visualization modes:
   - **Flow View**: Traditional directed graph with rectangular nodes
   - **Graph View**: Obsidian-style circular node graph with expandable neighbors

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Backend (Go)

1. **Install Go** (if not already):  
   [Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/)

2. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/CodeMapper.git
   cd CodeMapper
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Frontend (Visualizer)

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already):  
   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   cd CodeMapper
   npm install
   ```

## Quick Start üö¶

```bash
# 1. Build and run CodeMapper on your Go project
go run main.go -path "./ollama" -gopath "C:\Users\acer\go\pkg\mod" -analyze-deps "bitbucket.org/ggwp1,bitbucket.org/ggwp2" -out "full-codemap.json" -serve ":8080"
# 2. Open your browser and visit
http://localhost:8080
```

### Visualization Modes

**Flow View** (Default)
- Traditional directed graph layout
- Rectangular nodes showing function details
- Path highlighting and backtracking
- Export functionality

**Graph View** (Obsidian-style) üåê
- **Circular nodes** with package-based colors
- **Neighbor count indicators** (N) for hidden connections - click to expand
- **Interactive expansion**: Click nodes to expand/collapse neighbors
- **Real-time search** with live filtering
- **Node details panel** with dependencies and callers
- **Smooth zoom and pan** controls with mouse/touch
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+F`: Focus search
  - `Ctrl+C`: Center graph
  - `Ctrl+R`: Reset view
  - `Space`: Expand/collapse selected node
  - `Esc`: Clear selection

## Command Line Arguments Documentation

This application accepts the following command line arguments:

- `-path`: Specifies the path to the project directory to analyze (e.g., `./revel`).
- `-gopath`: Sets the Go module cache directory (e.g., `C:\Users\acer\go\pkg\mod`).
- `-analyze-deps`: Comma-separated list of dependencies to analyze (e.g., `bitbucket.org/ggwp1,bitbucket.org/ggwp2`).
- `-out`: Output file name for the generated code map (e.g., `full-codemap.json`).
- `-serve`: Starts a web server on the specified address to serve the results (e.g., `:8080`).
